* This repository contains the Java implementation for CLRS book whose name is Introduction to Algorithms
* The implementation not contains the mathematical proof in the book

## Features

Because this is the java implementation for CLRS, so I try to use some features in Java programming language:

1. Object-Oriented Programming
2. Exceptions
3. Generics
4. Interface
5. Annotation
6. Inner class
7. Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Questions and Answers

### I Use C/C++ not Java, what should I do?
* If you don't use Java, and you are looking for the solutions, then I recommend you this repository [CLRS](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS.git)



### I find it difficult to read the book, where can I find some help?

* If you feel it not very easy to read the book, then I recommend you first watch the video [MIT Public Class](http://open.163.com/special/opencourse/algorithms.html)



### I find some bugs in your code

* If you find some bugs in my code, you can **fork** this repository and have a **pull request**
